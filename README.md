# JavaAVLSearchTree

My implementation of the AVL Binary Search Tree
- Work in progress -

The tree can be used as a standard Binary Search Tree with each set of entries comprising of a Key and a Value.

For now it's possible to add entries and display the tree in String format. The Add method has been implemented, and the rebalancing algorithm seems to be working fine. The Test file can be run to show a demo of which cases the algorithm chooses internally.

I will add the other delete and get methods shortly.
