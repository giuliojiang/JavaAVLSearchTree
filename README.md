# JavaAVLSearchTree
```
My implementation of the AVL Binary Search Tree
- Work in progress -

The tree can be used as a standard Binary Search Tree 
with each set of entries comprising of a Key and a 
Value.

For now it's possible to add entries and display the 
tree in String format. The Add method has been 
implemented.

The rebalancing algorithm produces almost-balancing 
trees. I'll try to fix that.

I will add the other delete and get methods shortly.
